# Python L530 API (example)

This code is part of my project to create a light controller on an ESP32 (CYD) development board. To start this project I wrote this code in python to control my L530 Tp Link Smart Bulb. Which I then later translated into C++ code which the ESP32 uses.

 - [Rust and Python TAPO API](https://github.com/mihai-dinculescu/tapo)

Without the work done by these previous project I would  have been unable to write my test python script for interacting with the L530 Smart bulb.  
To note the Original TP Link API by K4CZP3R is no longer maintained and is not functional.
